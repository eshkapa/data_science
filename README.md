# Data Science
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by Elena Shkapa during the master course at Yandex.Praktikum:

## 01_Project_Yandex Music:
### Description: 
Comparison of musical tastes of Moscow and St. Petersburg. How different is the music that plays on the way to work on Monday morning from the one that plays on Wednesday or at the end of the work week.	
### Used libraries:
Python, Pandas, Numpy


## 02_Project_Research on the reliability of borrowers:
### Description: 
Based on statistics on the paying capacity of clients. I researched is the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact of the loan repayment on time.
### Used libraries:
Preprocessing data, Python, Pandas,Lemmatization, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,numpy


## 03_Real estate market analysis:
### Description: 
Using data from the Yandex.Realty service, i determined the market value of real estate objects and typical parameters of apartments.
### Used libraries:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Preprocessing Data, Math


## 04_Determination of a profitable plan for a telecom company:
### Description: 
Based on the data of the mobile operators customers, i analyzed customer behavior and found the optimal plan for the company.
### Used libraries:
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, SciPy, Statistics, Statistical Hypothesis testing, Math, Seaborn


## 05_Patterns that determine the success of game platforms:
### Description: 
Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms. I identified patterns that determine the success of a game.
### Used libraries:
Python, Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Preprocessing data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistics, statistical hypothesis testing, Seaborn, SciPy


## 06_Classifying profitable plan for a telecom company (introduction to ML):
### Description: 
Built the first Machine Learning model for the classification problem, which finds a suitable tariff
### Used libraries:
Machine Learning, Pandas, Numpy, Python, Seaborn



## 07_Supervised_Learning_Bank Churn Prediction
### Task:
Analysis of the outflow of clients from the bank to select a strategy (retaining old clients or attracting new clients)
Description:
Clients started leaving the bank every month. The probability of the client leaving the bank in the near future was predicted. A model with an extremely large value of the F1-measure was built with subsequent verification on a test sample. The metric has been brought to 0.62. Additionally measured AUC-ROC, correlated with F1-measure. Learning with a teacher. Dealing with unbalanced data.
